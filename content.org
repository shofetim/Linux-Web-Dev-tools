** Why I develop on linux
   If you really want to learn to code, learn linux.
** Do other people choose linux / stats
   - Websites deployed on linux
   - Languages/tools treat posix as the only first class citizen
     - epoll/kqueue as an example
     - node.js as an example
     - PHP https detection as an example
   - Discuss .Net
   - Remote administration / control
   - Support by virtualization providers
   - Universities that require unix knowledge
** A look at other 'nix systems
   Memory utilization
   TCP stack
   Security
   Speed
   Stayed with Linux
** So alot of people use Mac
   Its pretty
   Mutter + AWN + Gnome-do = pretty enough lets move on
** Intro
   Mostly if you are writing code everyday you just get good at your language,
   platform/framework, editor, revision control system, and maybe a good
   statistical analysis tool / linter. But going over those would just be
   interesting to someone who is also a pro dev...

   But to handle everything that comes up one needs a full toolbox of tools, and
   most of them are great for casual use to.
** Firebug / Developer tools
** HTTPFox (or wireshark)
** Chrome sniffer
** Curl -iv   
** PageSpeed/ySlow
** AB (apache benchmark)
** Memory Usage
*** htop
*** Python script
** rxvt-unicode & screen
** virtualbox   
** Gimp + Inkscape
** SLOCC
** CutyCapt
** CI Server
